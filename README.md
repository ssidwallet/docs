## Decentralized Identity

Decentralized Identity, or Self-Sovereign Identity, is a form of digital identity based on blockchain technology. It is a set of emerging technical standards aiming to revolutionize how identity is managed in the modern world, with a focus on privacy and security.

At FlexFinTx, we are building tools for secure digital identity for Africa. We built our core digital identity platform, FlexID, on the [Algorand](https://algorand.com) blockchain, and are building tools for organizations to easily get started using FlexID.

## Flex Hub

The Flex Hub API is a SaaS platform for organizations to manage their organizations on the FlexID platform. The API can be used to manage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) owned by the organization, issue out Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to FlexID holders, request holders to present Verifiable Presentations (VPs) to the organization, and revoke previously issued Verifiable Credentials.
